# lemming-js

Port of [lemming](https://github.com/superjoe30/lemming), my
[PyWeek #12 entry](http://www.pyweek.org/12/) to run in canvas
using the [chem game engine](https://github.com/superjoe30/chem/).

[Latest Demo](http://s3.amazonaws.com/superjoe/temp/lemming/index.html)

## Status

It's playable now but I am still working out some of the bugs introduced by porting.

## Developing

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and then `npm run dev`.
